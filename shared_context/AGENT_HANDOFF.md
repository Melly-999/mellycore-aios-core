# Agent Handoff

## Latest Completed Task (this track)

`MELLYCORE-SOURCE-ARENA-HYBRID-RENDERER-ADR-POST-MERGE-STATE-SYNC-001`

- Synchronized the Hybrid Renderer ADR and shared coordination docs with the
  now-merged canonical-`main` state from PR #8 (ADR status
  `ACCEPTED_CANONICAL_MAIN`), clarified implementation sequencing, and recorded
  the sync as its own task report — without changing architecture, runtime
  code, dependencies, NASA status, or deployment state.
- A follow-on P2 remediation
  (`MELLYCORE-SOURCE-ARENA-HYBRID-RENDERER-ADR-POST-MERGE-STATE-SYNC-P2-REMEDIATION-001`)
  then resolved two Codex review findings on PR #9: ADR Section 31 no longer
  sequences the Operations Data Contract as a prerequisite of the Source Arena
  renderer track (preserving track independence per `RUN_QUEUE.md`), and this
  handoff's latest-completed-task pointer now names the state-sync task. The
  Operations Data Contract remains `NOT_PRESENT_PENDING_INTEGRATION`.
- Docs-only. No site/runtime code, dependency file, or Three.js distribution
  was added or modified; no NASA retirement, release, or deployment occurred.
- Exact next task:
  `MELLYCORE-SOURCE-ARENA-HYBRID-RENDERER-ADR-POST-MERGE-STATE-SYNC-P2-REMEDIATION-PUBLISH-001`

## Prior Completed Task (this track, PR #8 merge)

`MELLYCORE-SOURCE-ARENA-HYBRID-RENDERER-ADR-PR-MERGE-001`

- After the ADR's operator acceptance (below), the acceptance record was
  independently re-reviewed twice: `-ACCEPTANCE-REVIEW-001` returned
  `NEEDS_FIXES` (two persisted gating-text contradictions in ADR Section 7's
  table header and Appendix A's NASA-row); `-ACCEPTANCE-REMEDIATION-001`
  closed both with two localized wording corrections; `-ACCEPTANCE-REVIEW-002`
  returned `PASS_HYBRID_RENDERER_ADR_ACCEPTANCE_REVIEW_002_COMPLETE`.
- `-PR-001` pushed the branch to canonical `clean-origin` and opened draft PR
  [#8](https://github.com/Melly-999/mellycore-aios-core/pull/8).
  `-PR-REVIEW-001` returned `PASS_HYBRID_RENDERER_ADR_PR_REVIEW_COMPLETE`.
  `-PR-READY-001` marked PR #8 ready for review; Sourcery's ready-state check
  did not trigger a fresh run because it had already exhausted its own
  external weekly diff-character quota — recorded as
  `WAIVED_UNAVAILABLE_BY_OPERATOR` / `EXTERNAL_WEEKLY_RATE_LIMIT_NOT_CODE_FAILURE`,
  never reported as passing; `main` has no branch protection or required
  status checks.
- `-PR-MERGE-001` merged PR #8 into canonical `main` via merge commit
  `f93be7018a1da3bba50eb66346b1f9e627a46dd2` (parents
  `06a7a421a06abbe38450d276af94985da8ddeba0` and
  `dcfcd8db2089e6f27b5aea59446244bf964f4aea`), confirmed by independent
  pre- and post-merge fresh clones: 245/245 tests passing in each, all
  validators passing, all five commit signatures verified, all five commits
  confirmed ancestors of the new `main`.
- The ADR's status is now **`ACCEPTED_CANONICAL_MAIN`**. Integration into
  canonical `main` makes the ADR's narrow, exact-clause supersession of the
  Holographic UI Spec (Section 7) authoritative and makes NASA runtime
  retirement (Section 24, Appendix A) an accepted future requirement — it
  does not execute that retirement, vendor Three.js, or implement any
  renderer. The complete CSS/DOM fallback, the no-build-step guarantee, and
  DOM's sole authority over labels/controls/navigation/safety state all
  remain unconditionally binding. The current legacy dashboard's NASA API
  calls remain present and unchanged. No release or deployment exists.
- Docs-only throughout. No site/runtime code, dependency file, or Three.js
  distribution was added or modified at any point in this chain.
- Exact next task:
  `MELLYCORE-SOURCE-ARENA-HYBRID-RENDERER-ADR-POST-MERGE-STATE-SYNC-REVIEW-001`
  (independent review of the post-merge documentation sync).

## Prior Completed Task (this branch, ADR acceptance)

`MELLYCORE-SOURCE-ARENA-HYBRID-RENDERER-ADR-ACCEPTANCE-001`

- Independent review `MELLYCORE-SOURCE-ARENA-HYBRID-RENDERER-ADR-REVIEW-003`
  returned `PASS_HYBRID_RENDERER_ADR_REVIEW_003_COMPLETE` against remediation
  commit `b95a741231d18ef712379837c7167aa22b37d42f`, confirming HR-01 through
  HR-06, RF-01, and RF-02 all closed, three valid signed commits, exact scope,
  and 245/245 tests passing.
- The operator then explicitly authorized recording acceptance of
  `docs/decisions/MELLYCORE_3D_RENDERER_HYBRID_ADR_001.md` at that exact
  reviewed baseline, on this exact branch, in one new signed local commit only
  — no push, no PR, no merge, no Three.js implementation, no runtime change,
  no NASA removal.
- The ADR's status became **ACCEPTED** (decision/specification level only,
  2026-07-20), later integrated into canonical `main` as recorded above.
- Docs-only. No site/runtime code, dependency file, or Three.js distribution
  was added or modified.

## Prior Completed Task (this branch, prior to acceptance)

`MELLYCORE-SOURCE-ARENA-HYBRID-RENDERER-ADR-REMEDIATION-002`

- Independent review `MELLYCORE-SOURCE-ARENA-HYBRID-RENDERER-ADR-REVIEW-002`
  confirmed HR-01 through HR-06 closed and returned `NEEDS_FIXES` on two
  residual findings (RF-01, RF-02) against remediation commit
  `7bd339e850ba491ce787d0c977aaa9f340e84579`. This remediation task closed
  both without accepting the ADR, implementing the renderer, or touching
  `site/`:
  - RF-01: corrected `docs/runbooks/MELLYCORE_LOCALHOST_QUICKSTART.md`'s
    "What this serves" section, which previously described the entire
    `site/` scaffold as "pure HTML/CSS, no JavaScript" even though
    `site/dashboard.html` in that same scaffold loads `dashboard.js` and
    makes live, automatic NASA Images API requests. The section now
    distinguishes `index.html` (zero JavaScript, zero network) from
    `dashboard.html` (loads JavaScript, not zero-network) at first mention,
    and still points to the detailed "Current network behavior, by page"
    section further down the same file.
  - RF-02: added a row to ADR Appendix A §A.1 mapping the Holographic UI
    Spec §6.2.4 planned README truthfulness-table entry
    (`NASA Images API — real, live, keyless`, not yet implemented in
    `README.md`) to its future provider-neutral replacement
    (`Local source fixture`, conditional on the same acceptance and
    implementation gates as every other Appendix A row).
- Docs-only. No site/runtime code, dependency file, or Three.js distribution
  was added or modified. The ADR's status remains **PROPOSED**; this
  remediation does not accept it or authorize implementation.
- Exact next task: `MELLYCORE-SOURCE-ARENA-HYBRID-RENDERER-ADR-REVIEW-003`
  (independent re-review of this remediation).

## Prior Completed Task (this branch, prior to remediation 002)

`MELLYCORE-SOURCE-ARENA-HYBRID-RENDERER-ADR-REMEDIATION-001`

- Independent review `MELLYCORE-SOURCE-ARENA-HYBRID-RENDERER-ADR-REVIEW-001`
  returned `NEEDS_FIXES` (findings HR-01 through HR-06) on the ADR commit
  below. This remediation task closed all six findings without accepting the
  ADR, implementing the renderer, or touching `site/`:
  - HR-01: added Appendix A (complete, conditional NASA-transition
    supersession map and provider-neutral replacement contract) and expanded
    ADR Section 24 to point to it.
  - HR-02: corrected `docs/runbooks/MELLYCORE_LOCALHOST_QUICKSTART.md` to
    truthfully separate `site/index.html`'s zero-external-network behavior
    from `site/dashboard.html`'s existing automatic `https://images-api.nasa.gov`
    call, reserving the zero-network claim for the future post-retirement
    Source Arena.
  - HR-03: made "supersedes"/"permits"/"authorizes" wording conditional on
    explicit operator acceptance everywhere the PROPOSED ADR is referenced (ADR
    Section 7 preface, Holographic UI Spec amendment notice).
  - HR-04: corrected `README.md`, `shared_context/PROJECT_STATE.md`, and
    `shared_context/ROADMAP.md` to state that AI Operations Intelligence is
    integrated into canonical `main` via PR #7 (previously described
    inconsistently as "pending integration"), and that the Operations Data
    Contract exists only on its own separate, unmerged branch
    (`NOT_PRESENT_PENDING_INTEGRATION`), without reordering that track.
  - HR-05: replaced ADR Section 23's approximate performance language with an
    exact, reproducible measurement contract (draw-call/triangle/DPR limits,
    reference viewports/browsers/device, measurement protocol, hidden-idle and
    lifecycle tests, required evidence fields) — future acceptance criteria,
    not measured results.
  - HR-06: split the ADR's single shared-state model into three explicit
    categories (DOM-owned, environment, renderer-lifecycle; Section 11) and
    specified the exact reduced-motion transition step order in both
    directions (Section 14).
- Docs-only. No site/runtime code, dependency file, or Three.js distribution
  was added or modified. The ADR's status remains **PROPOSED**; this
  remediation does not accept it or authorize implementation.
- Exact next task: `MELLYCORE-SOURCE-ARENA-HYBRID-RENDERER-ADR-REVIEW-002`
  (independent re-review of this remediation).

## Prior Completed Task (this branch, prior to remediation)

`MELLYCORE-SOURCE-ARENA-HYBRID-RENDERER-ADR-001`

- Created `docs/decisions/MELLYCORE_3D_RENDERER_HYBRID_ADR_001.md` (status:
  PROPOSED, not accepted) recording the operator's Hybrid renderer decision for
  Source Arena: a WebGL-enhanced renderer (one pinned, vendored Three.js ESM
  module) as progressive enhancement over a mandatory, complete CSS/DOM
  fallback.
- Added a narrow, additive amendment notice to
  `docs/specs/MELLYCORE_HOLOGRAPHIC_UI_SPEC_001.md` superseding only its
  dependency/build-step/renderer-technology clauses (Sections 4, 5.4, 5.9, 8)
  for Source Arena's enhanced-renderer layer; every other requirement in that
  document remains binding.
- Synced `README.md`, `shared_context/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`,
  `docs/runbooks/MELLYCORE_LOCALHOST_QUICKSTART.md`, and `docs/3d/README.md` to
  reference the proposed decision truthfully, without claiming implementation.
- Recorded the future task sequence (ADR review, NASA runtime retirement, the
  3D scene foundation, accessibility/performance QA, integration review) in
  `shared_context/RUN_QUEUE.md` and `shared_context/ROADMAP.md` as a parallel
  decision track that does not reorder the primary Data-Contract-first roadmap.
- Docs-only. No site/runtime code, dependency file, or Three.js distribution
  was added. This commit is on branch `docs/mellycore-3d-renderer-hybrid-adr-001`,
  pending push/PR under separate authorization, exactly like the pattern used
  by the AI Operations Intelligence task before it.
- The immediately prior integrated task on canonical `main` is
  `MELLYCORE-AI-OPERATIONS-INTELLIGENCE-001` (merged via PR #7). The Operations
  Data Contract task remains on its own separate, unmerged branch and is not
  touched or reordered by this task.

## Prior Completed Task (integrated into canonical main via PR #7)

`MELLYCORE-AI-OPERATIONS-INTELLIGENCE-001`

- Authored the documentation-only AI Operations Intelligence specification at
  `docs/specs/MELLYCORE_AI_OPERATIONS_INTELLIGENCE_SPEC_001.md`: logical contracts
  for the AI Estate Inventory, Unified Run Ledger, Skill Gap Detector, Memory
  Freshness Monitor, Recommendation Ledger, exact operator-approval, and the
  controlled improvement loop.
- Preserved the existing run/token, Loop Operations, and Context Gate contracts
  by reference; redefined none of them.
- Specification only — no backend, adapter, runtime, UI, scheduler, or provider
  integration is implemented or claimed. Durable detail is in
  `docs/tasks/MELLYCORE-AI-OPERATIONS-INTELLIGENCE-001.md` and Git history.
- The immediately prior task, `MELLYCORE-POSITIONING-REFRESH-001`, is integrated
  into canonical main.

## Current Operational Boundary

Implemented: report-only Loop Operations, guarded Context Gate through I4,
canonical context records/index/audit, static local surfaces, and legacy Live
Cockpit V2 prototype behavior.

Planned: Mission Control, Agent Activity, Context Pulse, Model Router, Unified
Run Ledger, Approval Queue, Memory & Recommendation Ledger, AI Estate Inventory,
Skill Gap Detector, Memory Freshness Monitor, real adapters, and guarded runtime
execution.

No planned domain may be described as implemented without repository evidence.
No consequential action may bypass operator approval.

## Next Run

`MELLYCORE-AI-OPERATIONS-INTELLIGENCE-001` is already integrated into
canonical `main` via PR #7 — no further action is needed on that commit.

The exact next roadmap task is:

`MELLYCORE-OPERATIONS-DATA-CONTRACT-001`

That task is specification/fixture scope only. It must not implement adapters,
approval execution, autonomous improvement, backend services, runtime-consumed
schema, or safety-rule changes. Its work exists only on the separate, unmerged
branch `docs/mellycore-operations-data-contract-001` (status:
`NOT_PRESENT_PENDING_INTEGRATION` in canonical `main`); this file does not
claim that branch is canonical.

## Next Run (Source Arena Renderer track)

The ADR architecture milestone is **`CLOSED_IN_CANONICAL_MAIN`** — PR #8
merged into canonical `main` via commit
`f93be7018a1da3bba50eb66346b1f9e627a46dd2`. Runtime implementation is
**`NOT_STARTED`**: no Three.js file, renderer code, or NASA-retirement change
exists anywhere in the repository. The exact next task in this parallel track
is:

`MELLYCORE-SOURCE-ARENA-HYBRID-RENDERER-ADR-POST-MERGE-STATE-SYNC-REVIEW-001`

That task is an independent review of this documentation-state sync only —
it must not implement the renderer, vendor Three.js, retire NASA, touch
`site/`, or push/PR/merge. After it passes, `MELLYCORE-SOURCE-ARENA-NASA-RUNTIME-RETIREMENT-001`
requires its own separate operator authorization and review gate; per ADR
Section 31 and `RUN_QUEUE.md`'s Parallel Decision Track, this renderer track
is independent of `MELLYCORE-OPERATIONS-DATA-CONTRACT-001` and does not begin
before, does not require, and is not gated by that contract's integration
into canonical `main` (status: `NOT_PRESENT_PENDING_INTEGRATION`, tracked
separately above). NASA retirement, Three.js vendoring, and the renderer
foundation task each remain separately unauthorized until their own explicit
tasks.

## Safety Reminders

- Use only the canonical `clean-origin`; never contact the retired remote.
- Do not store secrets, provider keys, tokens, account IDs, or private runtime state.
- Do not add trading, broker, order, or MellyTrade runtime behavior.
- Do not merge, deploy, release, or mutate remote state without explicit approval.
- Treat `shared_context/PROJECT_STATE.md` as durable state,
  `shared_context/RUN_QUEUE.md` as actionable sequencing, and completed task
  reports as historical evidence.
