## Latest Completed Task (this branch)

`MELLYCORE-SOURCE-ARENA-HYBRID-RENDERER-ADR-001`

- Created `docs/decisions/MELLYCORE_3D_RENDERER_HYBRID_ADR_001.md` (status:
  PROPOSED, not accepted) recording the operator's Hybrid renderer decision for
  Source Arena: a WebGL-enhanced renderer (one pinned, vendored Three.js ESM
  module) as progressive enhancement over a mandatory, complete CSS/DOM
  fallback.
- Added a narrow, additive amendment notice to
  `docs/specs/MELLYCORE_HOLOGRAPHIC_UI_SPEC_001.md` superseding only its
  dependency/build-step/renderer-technology clauses (Sections 4, 5.4, 5.9, 8)
  for Source Arena's enhanced-renderer layer; every other requirement in that
  document remains binding.
- Synced `README.md`, `shared_context/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`,
  `docs/runbooks/MELLYCORE_LOCALHOST_QUICKSTART.md`, and `docs/3d/README.md` to
  reference the proposed decision truthfully, without claiming implementation.
- Recorded the future task sequence (ADR review, NASA runtime retirement, the
  3D scene foundation, accessibility/performance QA, integration review) in
  `shared_context/RUN_QUEUE.md` and `shared_context/ROADMAP.md` as a parallel
  decision track that does not reorder the primary Data-Contract-first roadmap.
- Docs-only. No site/runtime code, dependency file, or Three.js distribution
  was added. This commit is on branch `docs/mellycore-3d-renderer-hybrid-adr-001`,
  pending push/PR under separate authorization, exactly like the pattern used
  by the AI Operations Intelligence task before it.
- The immediately prior integrated task on canonical `main` is
  `MELLYCORE-AI-OPERATIONS-INTELLIGENCE-001` (merged via PR #7). The Operations
  Data Contract task remains on its own separate, unmerged branch and is not
  touched or reordered by this task.

## Prior Completed Task (integrated into canonical main via PR #7)

`MELLYCORE-AI-OPERATIONS-INTELLIGENCE-001`

- Authored the documentation-only AI Operations Intelligence specification at
  `docs/specs/MELLYCORE_AI_OPERATIONS_INTELLIGENCE_SPEC_001.md`: logical contracts
  for the AI Estate Inventory, Unified Run Ledger, Skill Gap Detector, Memory
  Freshness Monitor, Recommendation Ledger, exact operator-approval, and the
  controlled improvement loop.
- Preserved the existing run/token, Loop Operations, and Context Gate contracts
  by reference; redefined none of them.
- Specification only — no backend, adapter, runtime, UI, scheduler, or provider
  integration is implemented or claimed. Durable detail is in
  `docs/tasks/MELLYCORE-AI-OPERATIONS-INTELLIGENCE-001.md` and Git history.
- The immediately prior task, `MELLYCORE-POSITIONING-REFRESH-001`, is integrated
  into canonical main.

## Current Operational Boundary

Implemented: report-only Loop Operations, guarded Context Gate through I4,
canonical context records/index/audit, static local surfaces, and legacy Live
Cockpit V2 prototype behavior.

Planned: Mission Control, Agent Activity, Context Pulse, Model Router, Unified
Run Ledger, Approval Queue, Memory & Recommendation Ledger, AI Estate Inventory,
Skill Gap Detector, Memory Freshness Monitor, real adapters, and guarded runtime
execution.

No planned domain may be described as implemented without repository evidence.
No consequential action may bypass operator approval.

## Next Run

Before roadmap work continues, review the single signed local commit on
`docs/mellycore-ai-operations-intelligence-001`. Push or PR creation requires
separate authorization.

After this specification commit is integrated, the exact next roadmap task is:

`MELLYCORE-OPERATIONS-DATA-CONTRACT-001`

That task is specification/fixture scope only. It must not implement adapters,
approval execution, autonomous improvement, backend services, runtime-consumed
schema, or safety-rule changes.

## Next Run (Source Arena Renderer track)

Review the single signed local commit on
`docs/mellycore-3d-renderer-hybrid-adr-001`. Push or PR creation requires
separate authorization. The exact next task in this parallel track is:

`MELLYCORE-SOURCE-ARENA-HYBRID-RENDERER-ADR-REVIEW-001`

That task is an independent review only — it must not implement the renderer,
vendor Three.js, or touch `site/`. This track does not begin before, and does
not require, `MELLYCORE-OPERATIONS-DATA-CONTRACT-001`'s integration.

## Safety Reminders

- Use only the canonical `clean-origin`; never contact the retired remote.
- Do not store secrets, provider keys, tokens, account IDs, or private runtime state.
- Do not add trading, broker, order, or MellyTrade runtime behavior.
- Do not merge, deploy, release, or mutate remote state without explicit approval.
- Treat `shared_context/PROJECT_STATE.md` as durable state,
  `shared_context/RUN_QUEUE.md` as actionable sequencing, and completed task
  reports as historical evidence.
