# Project State

Project name: MellyCore AIOS

## Canonical Product Identity

MellyCore AIOS is a local-first, operator-controlled **AI Operations
Observatory**. It exists to make models, agents, runs, context, memory,
recommendations, and approvals visible, inspectable, approval-gated, and
auditable.

The controlled improvement loop is:

`observe → analyze → recommend → approve → implement → validate → record`

Consequential action requires explicit operator approval. The system does not
autonomously change safety rules, merge, deploy, execute recommendations, or
store provider secrets.

## Durable Implemented State

- Static local homepage and Live Cockpit V2 prototype.
- Report-only Loop Operations Foundation: 9 registered loops, 1 exercised loop,
  0 production-enabled loops, and two human-invoked `project-health` runs.
- Context Gate through I4: guarded admission, 7 validated canonical records,
  content-free index, computed audit, and read-only dashboard Context surface.
- Current audit baseline: 0 findings, index current, 0 writes.
- Standard-library validation baseline: 245 tests.

The local dashboard's former NASA Images browser GETs have been retired from
`site/dashboard.html` / `site/js/dashboard.js` under
`MELLYCORE-SOURCE-ARENA-NASA-RUNTIME-RETIREMENT-001`, implemented on branch
`fix/mellycore-source-arena-nasa-runtime-retirement-001` and merged into
canonical `main` via PR #15 (merge commit
`e0cbc332ff90f8787d981c9d86be717633f22d4d`, reviewed head
`1478b95c82cb85fd5e0efdf433e928ca92cac69b`). Visual acceptance returned
`PASS_WITH_NON_BLOCKING_NOTES`; the two P2 findings (procedural swatch
palette, mission-rail scrollbar theming) were resolved before merge. The
Source Arena tab now renders a local, deterministic Source Archive dataset —
zero external requests, no API key. Historical NASA task reports and
`v0.2.0` release evidence remain untouched as the historical record. This
status is now canonical on `main`, not merely branch/PR-scoped.

## Specified, Not Implemented

The accepted Holographic UI specification defines Source Arena as the leading
visual metaphor and first hero image: a 390×844 mobile model-lens composition.
Overview/core/orbit/hull remains supporting imagery only. The complete
holographic/3D Source Arena, real operational adapters, and approval-execution
surface are not implemented.

The AI Operations Intelligence specification
(`docs/specs/MELLYCORE_AI_OPERATIONS_INTELLIGENCE_SPEC_001.md`) is **integrated
into canonical `main` via PR #7**; it defines the logical contracts for the
AI Estate Inventory, Unified Run Ledger, Skill Gap Detector, Memory Freshness
Monitor, Recommendation Ledger, exact operator-approval, and the controlled
improvement loop. It is specification only — no backend, adapter, runtime, or UI
is implemented or claimed by it; its modules remain `SPECIFIED`, not
runtime-implemented.

An accepted Source Arena Hybrid renderer decision
(`docs/decisions/MELLYCORE_3D_RENDERER_HYBRID_ADR_001.md`, status:
**ACCEPTED**, 2026-07-20, decision/specification level only) narrowly permits
a WebGL-enhanced renderer — one pinned, vendored Three.js ESM module, paired
with a mandatory complete CSS/DOM fallback — for Source Arena's central stage
only. Neither renderer is implemented; no dependency has been vendored. NASA
runtime retirement (accepted by this ADR as a prerequisite) is merged into
canonical `main` via PR #15 (merge commit
`e0cbc332ff90f8787d981c9d86be717633f22d4d`); the renderer and vendoring
themselves remain unimplemented and require their own separately-authorized
implementation task.

## Operator Decision — Option B Deploy Path

The operator selected **Option B**: the first deploy target now bundles the
cinematic showcase, the Source Arena static renderer slice, and an OpenRouter
Model/Cost Observatory as a **static snapshot only** (local fixture, no API
key, no backend, no live fetch, no model call). Full sequence and OpenRouter
Level 1/2/3 gating: `shared_context/ROADMAP.md`'s "Option B Deploy Path"
section; actionable next step: `shared_context/RUN_QUEUE.md`.

OpenRouter is **not implemented** anywhere in this repository. No OpenRouter
live catalog fetch, account usage, or API key is authorized; those remain
future-gated behind their own separate approval (Levels 2 and 3).

PR #17 (branch `feat/mellycore-source-arena-renderer-static-slice-001`, head
`08642089f9c062928c72d3968fd23843a5e9995d`) implements the Source Arena
static renderer slice and remains **blocked from merge** by a failed Sourcery
check flagging a possible XSS/static-analysis finding on `innerHTML` at
`site/js/dashboard.js:509` and `:554-561`. The Source Arena static slice is
not canonical on `main` until PR #17 merges clean. No deployment, release, or
OpenRouter implementation is authorized ahead of that merge and the readiness
sequence recorded in `ROADMAP.md`.

## Planned Direction

The Observatory roadmap includes Mission Control, Agent Activity, Context Pulse,
Model Router, Unified Run Ledger, Approval Queue, Memory & Recommendation Ledger,
AI Estate Inventory, Skill Gap Detector, and Memory Freshness Monitor. These are
planned domains, not current capability claims.

`MELLYCORE-OPERATIONS-DATA-CONTRACT-001` — translating the approved logical
contracts into fixture/schema artifacts and validation requirements — is
**integrated into canonical `main` via PR #13**
(https://github.com/Melly-999/mellycore-aios-core/pull/13), merge commit
`e0db28f06613d29028df96a2d651b6dfdf2f2aa8`, from branch
`docs/mellycore-operations-data-contract-001-v2` (tip `44dde78`). Integration
is documentation/schema/fixture scope only: the fourteen dashboard-facing
fixture entities defined in
`docs/specs/MELLYCORE_OPERATIONS_DATA_CONTRACT_SPEC_001.md`, and their
companion JSON Schema and example fixtures in `shared_context/operations/`,
now exist on canonical `main`. No adapter, backend execution, runtime-consumed
schema, or safety-rule change was implemented or authorized by this merge.

`MELLYCORE-OPERATIONS-DATA-CONTRACT-BRANCH-RECONCILIATION-001` had already
selected `-v2` as the canonical integration candidate ahead of this merge;
the original, differently-scoped `docs/mellycore-operations-data-contract-001`
branch (2026-07-19) remains unmerged, unpushed, and superseded — its
adoptable content (AI Estate Inventory, Skill Gap Detector, Memory Freshness
Monitor entities and its Truthful-State Labels reference) had already been
folded into `-v2` before this merge by
`MELLYCORE-OPERATIONS-DATA-CONTRACT-AI-ESTATE-SKILLGAP-MEMORY-001`, bringing
it to fourteen entities total.

Full merge evidence and validation: durable report
`docs/tasks/MELLYCORE-OPERATIONS-DATA-CONTRACT-POST-MERGE-STATE-SYNC-001.md`.
The original task report,
`docs/tasks/MELLYCORE-OPERATIONS-DATA-CONTRACT-001.md`, is a historical
snapshot of local-only, unpushed state prior to reconciliation and merge; it
is not a current-state claim. Real adapters, backend execution, and guarded
runtime work remain deferred to later, separately approved work.

## Release and Historical Integrity

`v0.2.0` remains the official historical release of Live Cockpit V2 / Social
Source Arena. PR #4 subsequently merged the accepted documentation-only
Holographic UI specification. Exact release, PR, branch, and commit evidence
lives in Git history and completed reports under `docs/tasks/`; it is not copied
throughout current shared context.

Earlier graph, loop, Context Gate, cockpit, provider-demo, release, and UI-spec
milestones remain preserved in their task reports and repository history.

## Safety Boundaries

- MellyCore AIOS is separate from MellyTrade; no trading or broker operations.
- No provider keys, credentials, `.env` values, account identifiers, or private
  runtime state in the repository.
- No autonomous merge, deployment, safety-rule mutation, or uncontrolled tool use.
- No production backend or recommendation execution is claimed.
- Remote mutation, implementation, deployment, and release work require separate
  explicit authorization.
